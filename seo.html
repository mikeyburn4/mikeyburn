                    <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
                    <p>Having trouble getting your site noticed? It might be time to delve into 
                        Search Engine Optimization, commonly known as SEO. While this subject can 
                        seem complex, at its core, SEO requires thorough research. Optimizing your 
                        site involves various elements such as naturally integrating key words, alternative 
                        text for images, ensuring mobile friendliness, and even avoiding specific key 
                        words. These actions are just small pieces of what search engines consider when 
                        assessing a site's relevance and authority. And I'd be delighted to assist you with 
                        this procedure.</p>
